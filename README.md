# Ceiling-Fan 

Implementing a simple ceiling fan which has two pull cords and the following characteristics:

· One cord increases the speed each time it is pulled. There are 3 speed settings, and an “off” (speed 0) setting. If the cord is pulled on speed 3, the fan returns to the “off” setting. \n
· One cord reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed setting. Once the direction has been reversed, it remains reversed as we cycle through the speed settings, until reversed again. \n
· The ceiling fan should be “off” on December 25th all day even if the cords are pulled.
· Assume the unit is always powered (no wall switch)
